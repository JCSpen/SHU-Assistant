# SHU-Assistant
This is the API version of Watson Asistant that we developed for the IBM project 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
an API version of the IBM Watson Assistant, which is a chatbot that was developed for the IBM Skills website. The chatbot is designed to provide students with pathways and resources based on their requests.

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of programming instructions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In this case, the IBM Watson Assistant API allows the chatbot to communicate with the IBM Skills website and provide its services to users.

To use this chatbot, one would need to clone the project onto their local machine and run it. However, it's important to note that an internet connection is required to use the chatbot because it relies on the IBM Watson Assistant API to function. Without an internet connection, the chatbot would not be able to access the necessary resources and respond to user requests.

Overall, this chatbot is a useful tool for students looking for guidance and resources related to their studies. By leveraging the power of IBM Watson and the IBM Skills website, it can provide tailored recommendations and assistance to help students achieve their goals.
